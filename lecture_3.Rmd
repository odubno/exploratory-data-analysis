## Stevens's Law
#### we might be off by a certain proportion
x = actual value
perceived value = Cx ^ beta 

- beta = .9 to 1.1 for length
- beta = .6 to .9 for area (ppl tend to underestimate area)
- beta = .5 to .8 for volume

#### Color
using color scale (difficult)
we are not very good at identifying color to value.
color vision deficiency 

### We're looking for features such as:
- Asymmetry (skewed left or right)
- Outliers (outlier because of a typo or really an outlier)
- Multimodality (how many humps; density curve -> single hump or multiple hump)
- Gaps
- Heaping/Rounding (histogram will look a certain way if you round the numbers)
- Impossibilities/Errors (negative numbers that shouldn't have been)

## Histograms
- primary tool for continuous data
- count/relative frequency/ cumulative freq./ density
