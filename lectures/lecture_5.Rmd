## Strip Charts
### see all the data.
### jitter (creates random noise)
- artificial noise, just to see the spread better.
## Strip Chart w/ boxplot
- great way to see summary statistics 
## Rug plot
- used on an axis
- an add on to a standard plot.
- gives the view of the two variables individually 
## Stem and leaf plot
- represents the first two numbers
## Dot Plot
- pretty much a histogram
## Normality
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000, 50, 10)
qqplot(1:3, c(4, 4, 6))
```

```{r}
x
```
