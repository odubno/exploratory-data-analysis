# Multivariate categorical data
- Bar Charts (Goto for categorical data)
- Cleveland dot plots
- Mosaic plots (parallen coordinate plots; difficult to understand)
- Fluctation diagrams
- Frequency data formats (coding)
- Drawing plots (coding)
- Occupational Mobility data

## Two continuous variables
1. for continuous data we make scatter plot

2. what about two categorical variables:
- don't use scatter plot
- stacked bar chart (not so good bc they don't line up)
- grouped bar chart (better bc everything lines up at the bottom)
2a. dependent variable is the fill color in the grouped bar chart
