### Quantile (general)
### Quintiles (dividing data into 5th)
### Deciles (dividing data into 10th)

# IQR (Inter Quartile Range)

## Determining the box plot outlier
- take one and a half distance away from the 3rd quartile
- then take half between the one and a half and the 3rd quartile.
#### Or
- the outlier is marked double the distance from the 3rd quartile
- the whisker is marked a quarter away from 3rd quartile

* Box plots are good for discrete data *

* Density curves you could overlap *

* It's nice to overlay the density curve of a histogram *

Check out the Ridgeline plot.

```{r}
df3 <- data.frame(score=rnorm(15, mean=15, sd=4))
ggplot() + geom_boxplot(data=df3, aes(1, score))+
  coord_polar() + 
  theme_wsj()
```
