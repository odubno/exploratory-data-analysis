### Ordered Elementary Tasks
1. Position along a common scale
2. Position along identical, nonaligned scales
3. Length
4. Angle / Slope
5. Area
6. Volume
7. Color hue / Color saturation / Density

### Weber's Law
• Consider two lines with lengths x and x + w.
• If w is very small, there is only a very small chance that we will notice that the
lines have diferent lengths.
• As w gets larger, the chance of detecting a diference increases.
• Weber’s law says that the chance of detecting a diference depends on the value
of w/x.

### Continuous Variables
We’re looking for features such as:

Asymmetry
Outliers
Multimodality
Gaps
Heaping / Rounding
Impossibilities / Errors

### Histograms
primary tool for continuous data
count / relative frequency / cumulative frequency / density
boundaries
binwidth

#### Layer 1

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df1 <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
```

```{r}

ggplot() + layer(data = df1,
mapping = aes(x, y),
geom = "hex",
stat = "identity",
position = "identity")
```
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(drat, vs)) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(drat, vs)) +
  geom_jitter()
```


- dodge: positions objects so that there is no overlap at the side.
- stack and fill: positions objetxs so that they are stacked. The stack instructions stacks objects in front of each other such that the largest object on top of one other (to make of equal height that are partitioned by the stacking variable)
- identity: no position adjustment
- jitter: adds a random offset objects so that they don't overlap.

## Stem and Leaf Plot
```{r}
prices <- c(379, 425, 450, 450, 499, 529, 535, 535, 545, 599, 665, 675, 699, 699, 725, 725, 745, 799)
stem(prices)
```



Data: df1
Mapping: x -> y; y -> x
Geom: point
Stat: identity
Position: identity

Data: df2
Mapping: num -> x; height -> y
Geom: bar (fill=green)
Stat: indentiy
Position: identity

Data: df3
Mapping: score -> y; 1 -> x
Geom: boxplot
Stat: boxplot
Position: identity

Data: df4
Mapping: time -> x; dist -> y

Position: idenity

```{r}
df3 <- data.frame(score = rnorm(25, mean = 15, sd = 3))
```

```{r}
ggplot() + layer(data = df3,
mapping = aes(1, score),
geom = "boxplot",
stat = "boxplot",
position = "dodge")
ggplot() + layer(data = df3,
mapping = aes(1, score),
geom = "boxplot",
stat = "boxplot",
position = "identity")
```

## Identifying rounding patters
- If the distribution in the histogram doesn't change when varying the bin width from, lets say 10, to 1, then we could conclude that there are rounding patters.
